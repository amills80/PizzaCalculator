# PizzaCalculator
Playing with Xamarin programming. Calculate how many pizzas you need to order based on party size. 

Currently, the entire iOS is remaining untouched. Reason being my iMac needs a major iOS and hardware update.  
Unfortunately, I'm waiting on the next batch of gigs to fund this upgrade. 
Until then, this project is strictly android-focused.
